MDF
1.✓ Adjust lengths of trays in makefile I+=18, II+=9?
   ✓ Adjust button size in enclosure.c to current
2.✓ BaseBoard Move/Add one pair of mounting holes
PCB Assembly
Button mounting board. 
3. ✓ Add version number V1.1 to silk screen 
4. ✓ J3 Label SW -> 0V, LED->SW
    ✓ J1 Label LED -> 0V
    ✓ Add centre line to Front silk screen
   Consider optional 3mm LED
    ✓ Trim 0.5mm from bottom board edge
   Consider 3xButton board for $2
5. Counter sink mounting holes if required to clear KS61 white keys.
6. mount buttons spaced off board by 1.6mm if required.
7. Create Dual button mounting board
8. KS61 Midi Interface 
   Cut 40 way socket strip 19/20. 19 way connector leaves VB unconnected.
   Bottom silk screen
    ✓ Reverse PB10 & PB12 on Buttons connector, Mark Pin 1
    ✓ Re-arrange GPIO Data output to common PB7 SDA
9. PC Button & LED Driver V1.0 
   Consider solder bridge to omit Qa1, or delete Qa1 & assoc components if not reqd
   Mark pin 1 on input and output connectors, maybe 0V,5V as well, top & bottom
10.When assembly is complete and tested use hot melt glue to secure keyboard connectors
Display Panel
    Stand buttons off button mounting board so that leads do not protrude though PCB back.
    PCBs mount flush to panel. Solder connectors after screwing pcbs to mdf
11. Cut recess for LCD backlight. A 12mm forstner bit and 1/4" chisel worked well
    Lightly sand edges of 7 seg display and LCD if reqd to fit
Division Piston Panel
    PCBs mount flush to panel. Solder connectors after screwing pcbs to mdf
12. Make 4-way joiners for extending lcd leads.
13. If LCD and Buttons do not work, but do work with 7 segment display disconnected
    Remove 7 segment display filter capacitors
