Done ✓
✓Buttons always on. Config LEDs dim/off, LEDs normal/invert
✓check 100kHz vs 400KHz etc i2c lcd load timing 8.4ms vs 2.2ms
✓Check button profile when midi not running vs running-Slow when GO not connected
✓Create ADC class, moved code out of SerialUI
✓Installed microsecond profiling to kbd,buttons,adc,WS2812,midi out to sysex,lcd,loop
  Partially implimented timing offset by profile ID
  Move print feature to objects that own them
  Simple multi display example
  Submit lcd pull request if possible
  Adopt multi lcd code avoiding redundant writes down to character level
  Offset object scheduling by pid
  Profile Midi out to midi in /Sysex response
  Offset CC command by 8 x midi channel + n adc
  Add ADC view to adc object
  Extend configuration beyond 16 bits for volatile controls eg logging, scope monitor
  Add scope monitor pin to profile PA13 or PA14
  Add to UserManual
    G [✓] 74HC164 Button LED Backlight enabled
    H [ ] 74HC164 Button LED inverted

  Explain real time & timing in user manual
  WS2812 Control on Lowest sharp when other notes silent for 5 seconds
  Build with makefile?
  Enhancement - Investigate whether LCD loading can be achieved without button LED flicker
  Enhancement - Page Turn Inc,Dec,Home,End one button/2 button
  Enhancement - Chord display
